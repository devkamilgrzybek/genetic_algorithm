---------------------
1. Just type <code>ruby 1.rb</code>
There are 3 examples as fallows  1.rb , 2.rb , 3.rb
<br>
Each of this example ilustrates diffrent kind of problem when dealing 
<br>
with genetics algoriths. 

Purpose
----------------------
App is created to provide basic understanding of genetics algorithms.
It uses knapsack problem to mutate optimal solutions.
